                    <p>Sites these days do all sorts of things, from displaying a simple image gallery to acting as a full blown application.  Generally the more functionality you give your site, the more you have to think about performance issues like website download speed.  That generally is the case because as you add functionality, you add code.  This is code that the site's server and your visitors browser has to parse and execute.</p>

                    <p>Does this mean you have to give up great functionality on your new site?  No, fortunately it doesn't. This is where we can help.  Reach out to us to found out just how affordable this service really is. </p>
