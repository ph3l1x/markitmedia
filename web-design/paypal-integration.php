                	<h1>The Benefits of Working with a PayPal Preferred Partner</h1>
                    <p>When working through Markit Media, you can enter into the PayPal Preferred Partner program.&nbsp; This program conveys many benefits: easier PayPal merchant account integration, better customer service and lower merchant account rates overall.</p>
                    <p><b>Easier and more robust setup process through a merchant account.</b></p>
                    <p>PayPal integration is extremely easy through the PayPal Preferred Partner program. PayPal will help you set up your account, find the best merchant products for your e-commerce site, offer you training modules and even help you expand your exposure through global PayPal Partner Programs. A PayPal Preferred Partner can set up a PayPal shopping cart, keep inventories and more.&nbsp; There is also a tiered program structure, to ensure that your PayPal merchant account will fit into your budget and give you only the features you need.</p>
					<p><b>Access to the PayPal account management team for faster customer service.</b></p>
                    <p>With the PayPal account management team, you don't have to wait for customer service. A PayPal Preferred Partner gets priority treatment when they need help, and this can be invaluable when trying to ensure the stability of your day-to-day operations. PayPal also sends exclusive communications to their partners to ensure that partners remain updated on current PayPal news and information.&nbsp; The PayPal account management team can answer any questions that you have regarding your PayPal account, and are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
					<p><b>Lower merchant account rates and additional payment options.</b></p>
					<p>A PayPal Preferred Partner gains access to discounted rates and lower fees, and these fees can significantly cut down on the per transaction overhead of a company.&nbsp; A PayPal Preferred Partner also has additional options for collecting funds: partners can accept credit cards by phone or connect to another existing merchant account to simplify their cash flow. All of these features can increase your overall profitability while reducing your expenses.</p>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                    <p>Any company interested in collecting funds through PayPal can benefit through becoming a PayPal Preferred Partner.
