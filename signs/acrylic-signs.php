                    <p>
                        Acrylic signs are created from a cast polymer, it is colorless, durable
                        and transparent, which makes for a perfect substitute for traditional
                        glass. Because of Acrylic signs depth and clarity they are often used
                        as lobby, directional and architectural signage.
