                    <p>One of the most powerful ways to attract attention at a trade show, an in-store display or to even draw people off the street is a poster. Large-scale posters with full color graphics and bold text may be one of the most cost effective ways to attract attention and deliver a message available today. With the advent of large format printing, not only is this process less expensive than ever before but with today's graphics programs, one of the most customizable.</p>
                    <p>With large, colorful posters, attendees at conventions and trade shows, those walking down the concourse at the mall or walking by a store front are all prime candidates to have their attention drawn to your advertising. Having a poster that is customized with your graphics and your message is a great way to do it.</p>
                    <p>Large format printing enables you to have multiple poster sizes including 8.5" x 11", 11" x 17" and 12" x 18" to fulfill differing needs. Also, poster printing equipment can handle standard bond paper all the way up through 100lb poster board in either a gloss or matte finish which means you can have the poster sizes you need on a paper format that will suit your purpose. If your marketing or advertising campaign could use posters, there's no reason you can't have exactly what you want.</p>
